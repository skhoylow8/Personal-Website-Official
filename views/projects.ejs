        <h3>Khoylow Realty Project</h3>
        <p class="projectDescription">
          Currently working on a webpage that incorporates both front-end
          and back-end skills. The front-end involves using HTML, CSS, as well as Bootstrap,
          and JavaScript. The back-end involved the use of Node.js to retrieve the files
          from a server. It also involved using the Google Map API and Mongo DB to the property
          information.

        <h3>Online Web Development Certificate</h3>
        <p class="projectDescription">
          This certificate demonstrates my completion of an online web development
          course. Learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and many more front-end skills. Also learned
          Node.js, Express.js, templating, SQL and NoSQL Databases, APIs, and React.js. Completed
          many projects to solidify what I was taught from the videos and I also worked on projects outside of
          the course to gain more experience.
