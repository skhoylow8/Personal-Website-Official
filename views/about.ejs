        I am a fourth year undergraduate student at UCLA pursing my bachelors degree
        in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Computing. I have taken 4 programming classes at my university 
        and I have also interned at a startup company as a Mobile Developer for 10 months. 
        I am not only interested in web development, but I am also interested in research, specifically the overlap between websites and psychology. 
        I am currently part of a research lab where I hope do conduct my own research and I am also working as a Web Developer for an
        organization at my school.
        <br />
        <br />
        My hobbies include soccer, reading,
        and, of course, coding. I am the youngest of three by a few minutes (we
        are triplets). I work great in teams and independently. I am very responsible
        and always complete my work.
        <br />
        <br />
        Please don't hesitate to contact me with any opportunities. Thanks.
